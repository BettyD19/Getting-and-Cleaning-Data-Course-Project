 # **Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project**

 This is the course project for Getting and cleaning data coursera project. We used Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set and cleaned the data per the instruction in the project.

 The following files are avaliable

 - **CodeBook.md** that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
 - **run_analysis.R** which performs:
       * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
       * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
       * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
       * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
       * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

  - **tidy_data.txt** the file is exported after the datasets going through the a steps.
